# Hackmud 'library' Project (0.2.0 Alpha)
## By: \_meta\_
This Project was created for the development of a Hackmud Library Service named 'APL' (Atheneaum Public Library). It is a in-game library for information of several sorts.

This page will be updated as more work is done on this Project.

Additional information can be found in the Wiki for this project: https://github.com/b0wti3/hm_lib/wiki

If you would like to help me out with this Project, or just want to give suggestions / comments, feel free to contact me in Hackmud's Discord Channel with my handle @meta.
