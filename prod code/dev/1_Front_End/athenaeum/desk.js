	//desk.js - Part of the 'Library' Project; By: _meta_
	//Purpose: Main library script. Used to: 
	//  * Access top level script tools
	//  * Access a user-offered service list
	//  * See a collated account of the game's lore and user-made events. (History book of some kind)

    const page = #fs.athenaeum.core(args)
    return page;
//BUGS NOTICED:
// also probably worth mentioning neither logo appears in desk if you give it {}
// or just give it args in general without size:"slim" being one of them
}
