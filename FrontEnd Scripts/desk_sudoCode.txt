desk: main interface with the rest of the 'library'

//setup phase

username = context.username
acii = #s.lib.acii() //sets up the acii art (prob should be stored in a db instead?)
regusers = #s.lib.userlist //Gives a list of currently authenticated users.

if username !match user in regusers {
	throw an error, and direct the user to contact meta for authentication.
	}

//If user is in the database, but either forgot to enter the password param or entered a wrong one,
// throw another error, and direct them accordingly. (Maybe make the password entry system 
// protected after so many attempts?)

if username match user in regusers && passwordEntered = passwordStored {
	throw welcome text, and prompt user to choose from a list of (listed) possible options
}

// To test the desk functionality, have 2 options: Send a Funny Message; Display a list 
// of 10 safe scripts that are important/well-made utility tools for the game.
