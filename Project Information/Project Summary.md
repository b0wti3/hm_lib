# ARP - Project Summary
## By: \_meta\_

This document has been created to describe the ARP Project. In the following, I describe the purpose and goals of this project. Everything / anything within the scope of this project is open and free for others to repurpose and use as they see fit. However, it would be preferred if you could give credit to it's source if you do so. Also, I welcome any suggestions / bug checking that you can provide! :-)

## What is ARP?
ARP stands for Atheneaum Repository Protocol. In short, it is supposed to be an information cataloging and storage service on Hackmud itself within game. While providing useful information and references for players to access and use, it feeds upon the ability to absorb user-provided content into it's framework.

It's framework is split into 2 parts. First, it provides structured access to databased information. Second, it allows for registered users of the system to upload and edit their own content so that ARP can eventually absorb and disseminate multi-user content.

## How is ARP's Data Protected

To secure the integrity of the data, several saftey methods are to be put into place:
* Role-Based Access Controls: Edit, Creation, and Deletion of data owned by ARP is strictly controlled. Access to content owned by registered users are regulated to private-access, but allowance for owners of content to assign read priviledges to any other registered user. Read priviledges to any content owned by ARP is open to all registered and unregistered users.

* On-Demmand DB Backups (Online & Offline): At any notice, any and all data can be backed up to either an online location within Hackmud, or even offline. This data will be backed up in a way to be able to be restored back into an ARP production environment in hackmud.

* Trust No One Private Access: All private content cannot and will not be accessed by any uninvited registered users other that it's owner (based on DAC). Only after a user has submitted an article to be published will ARP be able to read it. This provides the user a measure of privacy. For no reason will ARP be held responsible any missuse of this system, unless the content or it's intent is against the rules of the mud.

### ARP cannot and will not initially provide user-obfuscation for the content they create. While all efforts to provide a secure environment, data integrity efforts will be ARP's first priority, along with data backup / restoration.
